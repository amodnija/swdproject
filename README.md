A small Django web app I created as an assignment for an induction.

This app allows users to apply for leaves and view the list of applied leaves. Users can also approve or disapprove leaves.

The website has three pages: the apply for leave page, the leave list page, and the edit approval page.

The apply for leave page contains a simple form to apply for a leave.

The leave list lists out the various details of every registered leave application and contains hyperlinks to the edit approval pages for each leave

The edit approval page show the details of the leave and allows users to approve or unsapprove it.

The web app ensures that a user can only have 10 leaves with availibility set as 'yes'.

If time permits, I wish to add user authentication and user management to this app.

(This repo also contains a python virtual environment with a 3.x django installation)
